# User Stories
As a developer of the node software (client, launcher, node, etc), I want to be able to: 
- create a network.
- include mainnet data in that network.
- include my development workstation as a node in a network.

# subgoals
- allow provisioning of assets, separate from initialization of network: we should allow node provisioning to happen and make the activation point be configurable
- allow the shutdown of a network at a switch block, allowing the network to come back up all-together.
